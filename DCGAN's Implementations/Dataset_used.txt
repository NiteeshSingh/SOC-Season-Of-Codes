//how to use this dataset with code provided

----My approch

-- used kaggle API to directly fetch data from kaggle directly to my colab working enviornment


/// or \\

 -- download data into and upload into colab working enviornment as zip file 
 -- then specify correct path in unzip command (!unzip 'file path')
